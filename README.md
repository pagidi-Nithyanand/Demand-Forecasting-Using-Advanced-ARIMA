## Introduction
Demand forecasting is a crucial aspect of supply chain management. This project demonstrates the use of an advanced ARIMA model to predict sales demand based on historical data. By leveraging R, we preprocess data, perform feature engineering, remove outliers, and utilize the ARIMA model to make accurate forecasts.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have R installed on your machine along with the following libraries:
- `tidyverse`
- `forecast`
- `corrplot`
- `dplyr`

You can install these packages using:
```R
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "forecast", "corrplot", "dplyr"))
```
## Results
The results of the forecast are visualized using the forecast package's plotting capabilities. Adjustments and validations are performed to ensure the accuracy of the predictions.
## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
